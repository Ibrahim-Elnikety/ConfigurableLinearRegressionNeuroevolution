The autogenerated png and txt files contain summaries for each model.
The default run parameters were used for each except for the parents, children,
mutations (number of copies, not std and chance) and generation to get around 1000 total individuals.
The model defaults those values to 3, 6, 2 and 37.
The files contain RMSE, MSE, MEAN(not absolute) and a confusion matrix on all the sets for each model,
and the names are generated based on params, and the files include all run configurations and set sizes.
Since the neural network is a perceptron, the model images of the neural network specifically are not necessary
and instead models how an individual generation is simulated.
If the number of reviews is the same, the same linear regression will be used. The program will use
the Mooreâ€“Penrose inverse matrix to find the least of squares, so all of these use the same linear regression.
Each output file contains the runtime of the neuroevolution and ignores linear regression and the
image/output file writing. Runtime for linear regression is O(n^(1+beta)) where beta is between 1 and 0
and n is total words. Runtime for neuroevolution tends to be around O(n) where n is total individuals * unique words,
or O(individuals*total_words^beta).
